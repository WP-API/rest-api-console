A console for your site's REST API that lives in your WordPress admin.

== Description ==

The REST API Console is an interactive way to explore the [WordPress REST API][] through your normal WordPress admin. Great for learning about the API, tinkering with data on your site, or finding out what your site is exposing. (Also pairs well with a fruity red.)

You'll need to have the [WordPress REST API][] plugin (v2 or later) installed to use this. You can only access your local site through this plugin.

Don't have a WordPress site handy? Want to try-before-you-buy? Check out [demo.wp-api.org](http://demo.wp-api.org/) for a publicly visible version!

Congratulations!
